<h1>Yarnline</h1>

<p>Welcome to Yarline, a little mashup that takes your (or anybody else's) projects on Ravelry and 
show them to you as a timeline looking like this:</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="/images/screenshot.png" alt="yarnline screenshot" />
</div>

<p>How to use it? Dirt simple: click on the '<i>authenticate</i>' button
below, confirms that you'll allow this app to do its thing (we're only peeking
in project lists and not doing anything else, I swear) and... voil&agrave;. To
look at the timeline of anybody else but you, put their ravelry username in 
the top-right box and click on '<i>generate</i>'.</p>

<p>Happy Yarlining!</p>

<div align="center">
    <form method="GET" action="/auth">
        <input type="submit" value="authenticate" />
